# RaptorDown
A roguelike with LibTCOD and Python. 

Created for CodeDay San Diego Spring 2015, won Best Overall. 

![a sample of gameplay](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SilverWingedSeraph/RaptorDown/master/screenshot.jpg)

Requires the appropriate libtcod.so; 64-bit Linux is included, if you use another architecture or operating system, you will need to download LibTCOD 1.5.1 for yourself.

It is a fairly simplistic game; fight monsters, collect loot, level up.
There is a twist, however; the Cylons are after you! After a certain
number of turns in each level, the Cylons will appear and swarm you. While
you can fight them for a while, you can't do so indefinitely, so the
object of the game is to collect the fuel that allows you to jump away
to the next level.

Good luck!
